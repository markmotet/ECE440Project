# ARM Image Processing Project for BeagleBone Black

This project aims to create an efficient, reliable software that runs on an ARM chip for the BeagleBone Black board. Our primary function is to manipulate small black and white images using a Gaussian blur algorithm, implemented through convolution and relying exclusively on integer arithmetic. This approach has been chosen to maintain high performance and minimize the computational load on the ARM processor.

The project has been divided into two main phases:

## Version 1
In the first version, our goal is to implement the basic functionality of the Gaussian blur algorithm. We will ensure that the algorithm is working correctly and providing the expected results, and we will establish a baseline for the performance of the software.

## Optimization Phase
In the second phase, we will dive deeper into the performance aspects of our software. We will analyze the generated machine code and implement changes to further optimize the algorithm. These optimizations will aim to improve the efficiency of the image processing algorithm while maintaining or improving the quality of the results.

## Coding Standards
Throughout the development process, we will adhere to established C coding standards. Our goal is to write clear, readable, and maintainable code. We believe that by adhering to these standards, we can reduce the number of bugs in our software and make it easier for other developers to understand and contribute to our project.
